                                Mapping Fires using a Drone Swarm is a 2-person group project for the course CSCI 513 - Autonomous
                                Cyber Physical Systems at USC.
                            </p>  
                            
                            <h2>TL;DR</h2>

                            <p>
                                Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as drones have the ability to fly over varied 
                                terrain without requiring human interaction. We explore the use of a swarm of UAVs for fire 
                                fighting. While a swarm of drones is far too small to help put out a fire, it can be very useful 
                                in searching for a fire and mapping its extent in real time, giving firefighters on the ground 
                                crucial information. In this paper, we use a 2D grid-world to demonstrate how a swarm of drones 
                                can be used to efficiently find and map a spreading fire.
                            </p>

                            <h2>The Inspiration</h2>

                            <p>
                                Firefighting is incredibly dangerous and highly time sensitive. Fires can spread quickly, and 
                                having a real-time layout of the fire would allow for quicker response times and more strategic 
                                use of firefighting resources. Aerial vehicles are best suited for the task of mapping fires 
                                since they do not need to navigate through the ground terrain and can see a larger portion of the 
                                terrain than ground vehicles. However, manually flying a swarm of drones requires skilled 
                                manpower, and as the swarm size increases, communication and planning become increasingly 
                                difficult. By making the system autonomous, we can eliminate the need for human interaction, 
                                and leverage the instant communication between drones to implement more sophisticated and 
                                efficient mapping algorithms. In this paper, we model the use of a swarm of UAVs to search 
                                for fire within a given region, map the fire's perimeter, and then continually update its 
                                mapping as the fire spreads in order to maintain an accurate picture of the fire's perimeter 
                                in real-time. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Perimeter coverage is highly dependent on the number of drones being used. If we do not have enough 
                                drones, perimeter updates can be slow and we can see a greater difference between the new and old 
                                boundaries.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Design and Implementation</h2>

                            <h3>Environment</h3>

                            <p>
                                The simulation environment is a 2-dimensional grid-world representing an area of land as viewed 
                                from above. Each square contains labels that describe whether it is on fire and whether there is 
                                a drone above it. We use a simple ellipse model for the spread of the fire, which always remains 
                                contiguous. We model the spread of fire given a particular wind speed, making the assumption that 
                                the terrain is flat. The direction of wind is always assumed to be from south to north, although 
                                this does not bias our results since the drones' initial positions are set to random locations on 
                                the edge of the grid-world. In a real-life version of this system, we assume that the drones 
                                would be equipped with downward facing infrared cameras to detect the presence of fire. In our 
                                model, we simulate this by allowing each drone to perceive the contents of 9 grid boxes - the 
                                one it is currently above, and all grid boxes either adjacent or diagonally adjacent to it. 
                            </p>

                            <h3>Simulation</h3>

                            <p>
                                Each simulation begins with some number of contiguous grid squares already on fire. When the 
                                drones spawn, they are provided with a bounding box known to contain fire, and their first task 
                                is to find the fire within that box. As soon as the fire is detected by some drone, the system 
                                enters a mapping stage, where the remaining drones move to the position where the fire was first 
                                detected, and then proceed to navigate around the fire in order to map its perimeter. The drones 
                                continuously update their mapping as the fire spreads until the simulation is terminated.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Fire Model</h3>

                            <p>
                                The shape and rate of spread (ROS) of a fire is dependent on many factors, including environment 
                                temperature, type and distribution of burning materials (i.e. ``fuel"), wind speed and direction, 
                                and slope of terrain. Simpler models of fire from the literature often assume a flat terrain with 
                                a single source of wind and uniform fuel. With the wind as the driving factor for fire spread, 
                                the spread of fire is typically modeled as an ellipse whose eccentricity is determined by the 
                                speed of the wind; the stronger the wind, the greater the eccentricity.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Algorithm</h3>

                            <p>
                                Our autonomous drone swarm uses a centralized system, where each drone can communicate freely 
                                to a central controller, which provides instructions to the drones to achieve coordination. 
                                Each individual drone uses logic of its own to tackle problems corresponding to itself, and the 
                                centralized controller performs the higher level planning of the swarm.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Metrics</h2>

                            <p>
                                "Percent Perimeter Detected" represents the percentage of the fire's actual perimeter currently 
                                detected by the drones. "Percent Perimeter Detected (soft)" incorporates some flexibility into 
                                the perimeter coverage metric; when checking whether the drone detected a certain fire on the 
                                perimeter, the drone also counts as having detected that fire if it detected some other fire 
                                adjacent to it. The "Drone Efficiencies" metric maps the ID of each drone to the percentage of 
                                the total fires discovered that was discovered by that drone. Generally, we assume that the 
                                closer the efficiency values are to each other, the better, since this implies that the work 
                                is being spread out more equally among the drones and that drones are not being put to waste. 
                                Finally, the "ROS Estimate" gives the drone-estimated rate of spread (in km/h) at the right 
                                flank, left flank, head, and rear of the fire. It is calculated by comparing the positions of 
                                the rightmost, leftmost, uppermost, and lowermost squares that are on fire (from the drones' 
                                perspective) 30 minutes apart. The "Actual ROS" is calculated the same way, but using the the 
                                ground truth's values for those reference points instead of the drones'.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Results</h2>

                            <p>
                                We also looked at the relationship between the number of drones and the average standard 
                                deviation in drone efficiencies during a simulation, and found that the greater the number of 
                                drones, the smaller the average standard deviation in efficiency. This was slightly surprising, 
                                since we thought that increasing the number of drones might make it more likely that some drones 
                                would follow too closely behind others, leading to poor efficiency. It may mean we need to tweak 
                                our path-planning algorithm to work better with lower numbers of drones. 
                            </p>
