## Hello there 👋 — welcome to the control room 🎛️

You made it past the hero and into the source—the place where insights are engineered and pixels get KPIs. This site (like my work) is hypothesis-driven, measured, and tidy: components are composable, styles are sensible, and everything should earn its keep.

---

### What you'll find 🔍
- **Clean patterns**: Composable components and sensible styles.
- **Measured decisions**: Data over drama; results over rhetoric.
- **Experiments**: The occasional variant that didn’t beat baseline 🧪.
- **Readability first**: Clarity over cleverness 🧼.

### If you're borrowing or debugging 🛠️
- **Borrow freely**—a ⭐ is appreciated.
- **See something odd?** Assume it’s an A/B test—then tell me which variant won 📈.

### Visit the shiny side 🌐

Curiosity already puts you above baseline. Carry on.
