                                Posture Coach is a group final-year capstone project for the Bachelor's of Engineering in 
                                Computer Science at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering
                            </p>  
                            
                            <h2>TL;DR</h2>

                            <p>
                                Posture Coach is a cross platform mobile application that aims to help prevent injuries and improve 
                                the quality of people’s workouts with just a smartphone, that uses the system’s inbuilt camera to 
                                detect the user’s exercise pose and provide personalized, detailed recommendations on how the user 
                                can improve their form in real time.
                            </p>

                            <h2>The Inspiration</h2>

                            <p>
                                Fitness is a vital component of our health and well-being. Due to the circumstances caused by the 
                                covid-19 pandemic, most people do not have access to a gym or fitness equipment; hence many people 
                                have resorted to exercising by themselves at home. People have become dependent on technology to 
                                receive appropriate fitness guidance and training.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Since most gyms have been closed, people have now resorted to working out at their homes instead. 
                                Exercises such as squats, deadlifts, and shoulder presses are beneficial to health and fitness, 
                                but they can also be very dangerous if performed incorrectly.
                                Most people need guidance to maintain the correct posture while exercising. Technology can be used 
                                to monitor and provide this guidance by making use of Pose Estimation.
                            </p>

                            </figure>

                            <h3>Pose Estimation</h3>

                            <p>
                                The PoseNet algorithm is a pre-trained model for pose estimation. It is available on TensorFlow 
                                lite and TensorFlow.JS libraries, which makes it easier to be implemented on mobile device 
                                applications. It is designed to run on mobile devices and browsers. It takes a processed camera 
                                image as the input and then generates 17 key points of body parts along with their confidence 
                                score between 0.0 and 1.0.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Keypoint Normalization</h3>

                            <p>
                                We must create our own parser to use the raw keypoint data after executing pose estimation. We 
                                also need to generalise our software to cater for individuals with various body length measurements, 
                                camera distance, and other related aspects. We normalise the pose based on the torso's length in 
                                pixels to accommodate for these variances. The average distance between the neck keypoint and the 
                                right and left hip keypoints is used to compute torso length. Distances are thus expressed as 
                                ratios of torso length
                            </p>

                            <h3>Perspective Detection</h3>

                            <p>
                                We must resolve the ambiguity in the camera viewpoint for some workouts. The bicep curl exercise, 
                                for example, must be done from the side of the body and can be done with either the left or right 
                                arm. We need to figure out which arm is doing the work. By analysing which key points are most 
                                apparent (left or right side keypoints) throughout all frames of the activity, we can determine 
                                which arm is conducting the exercise in the video. We do this by comparing keypoint confidence 
                                scores for each side.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Evaluation</h3>

                            <p>
                                We perform exercise pose evaluation using a geometric approach. We first determine the metrics 
                                based on which we must evaluate the user’s posture for each exercise. We compute body vectors 
                                from key points of interest and use personal training guidelines to design geometric heuristics 
                                and evaluate the body vectors.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Feedback</h3>

                            <p>
                                Our application provides real-time audio and text feedback to the user as they are performing the 
                                exercise. Using the results of the evaluation, we provide positive reinforcement messages such 
                                as "Good work", "Well done" for a correctly performed exercise and suggestions on how to improve
                                posture such as "you should lift your arm higher", or "squat lower" for an incorrectly performed 
                                exercise.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Exercises</h3>

                            <p>
                                Currently, we have implemented the evaluation of 4 exercises - Bicep Curl, Shoulder Press, Front 
                                Raise, and Squats, as shown above.
